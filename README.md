This is a Very simple direct kinematics library intened to solve the position and velocity of the end-effector of a robot given a position and velocity of its joints.
This library includes also a symbolic engine based on {{sympy}} which let you to get the symbolic expressions of the jacobian and the direct kinematic function.

The geometric description of the robot is possible thanks to a class which acts as a Denativ-Hartemberg transformation.
